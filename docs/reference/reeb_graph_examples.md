# Mesh-Derived Reeb Graphs

These are some of the Reeb graphs used by Tu &al (2019; Fig. 8) to
benchmark the multi-pass and single-pass algorithms. The original meshes
were obtained from the `AIM@SHAPE` Shape Repository, while the authors
computed Reeb graphs using a custom C++ implementation.

## Usage

``` r
david
buddha
topology
flower
```

## Format

Objects of class `reeb_graph`.
